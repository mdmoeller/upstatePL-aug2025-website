        The Upstate PL Seminar brings Programming Languages researchers together
        from across New York State and surrounding areas for a day of informal talks
        and discussions. We accept talks on complete research and work in progress, dealing with
        topics of interest to the programming languages and systems communities. See the talk
        proposal form for more information.

              <summary>Abstract</summary>
              <p>
                OCaml is the biggest development language at Jane Street Capital, powering client-facing systems,
                implementing trading strategies, and interfacing with exchanges around the world. For some of our
                strategies, low-latency execution of a trade is vital -- every microsecond counts. In such systems, the
                unpredictability of OCaml's garbage collection can be disastrous. We thus have teams who have developed
                approaches to writing OCaml code that does not allocate new structures on the heap (and thus avoids
                garbage collection); this code is difficult to write and maintain.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are thus designing a plan to bring unboxed types to OCaml. Unboxed types exist in most other
                languages; they are sometimes called value types. Constructing an element of an unboxed type requires no
                allocation -- that is, no box. OCaml has resisted unboxed types because it is hard for a language to mix
                both unboxed types and parametric polymorphism (also called generic functions). This talk will describe
                why unboxed types and polymorphism don't mix and will explore aspects of our upcoming design and
                implementation.
